# My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! ðŸŽ‰ This is where I document everything I learn daily as I start my journey into Python programming.

## ðŸ“… Daily Progress

I am organizing this repository day-wise. Each dayâ€™s learning will be added as a new folder or file under the `days/` directory.

### Days Summary
- **Day 1:**
          Data Types and Variables
          Strings, integers, floats, and booleans
          Variables and type casting
          Basic string operations (len(), concatenation, slicing)

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Repository?

- **Progress Tracking:** To stay motivated by seeing my daily progress.
- **Portfolio:** To showcase my learning for future projects.
- **Learning Journal:** To reflect on what Iâ€™ve learned each day.
